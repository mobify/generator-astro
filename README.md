Astro Generator
===============

In order to generate an Astro project, run the following script:

```sh
./generate.sh
```

Or if you don't have the repo checked out:

```sh
bash <(curl -fsS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mobify/generator-astro/master/generator.sh)
```

Why `generator-astro` and not `astro-generator`
-----------------------------------------------

Initially we envisioned using (Yeoman)[http://yeoman.io/] for the generator. Yeoman generators are prefixed with `generator-` and so we followed that convention.
